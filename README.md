# Hello-world
This repository is meant to be my code canon.
My journey into coding has been up and down. Mainly because I thought studying code was the same as writing code. I didn't want to keep going back and forth searching for solutions if I had a problem. My thoughts were if I know the code when I see it, I could write it. Now I'm learning that you can use resources like a dictionary. You can study it, and write sentences with the words. In the case of coding; I can do projects and use the resources for coding at the same time. I'm good enough to do so. There are projects I want to search for, participate on, and do in order to really learn I will trust my brain. This is my brain trust.

The changes I'm making to this branch are mainly notations on my journey to learning code, and applying my thoughts on that path.
